# Orthogon

**What is Orthogon?**

Orthogon is an acrylic edge-lit name badge. Our goals for Orthogon are beauty, simplicity, and accessibility to hobbyists.

Orthogon is composed of just a few pieces, including:

* An acrylic body through which light shines. The first iteration is designed around 1/4ish" acrylic (5.6 ~ 6 mm thick)
* A simple driver board which includes 4 SK6812 Mini LEDs (Mini Neopixels) and an ATtiny85 to drive them
* A means of clipping Orthogon to your clothing and connecting to the battery system
* A battery system that includes a LiPo cell, charge/protect/boost (CPB) circuitry, and a mating clip to attach to the visible portion of Orthogon
